Love and Cookies
Like theres a button in front of you and a little sign that reads " Press for Cookies". And every time you press it a giant cow turd falls on your head, but you keep on pressing and once out of 68 times you get a cookie.
And it's the best damn cookie you ever ate.
And you realize while you eat it, you will willingly get shit on 68 more times just to get another fucking cookie.
Then one day no more shit no more cookies. No matter how many times you push the button nothing. 

That's what love feels like.... and thats why I hate cookies
